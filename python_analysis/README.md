# Analysis Introduction
Several analyses have been explored and prototyped using hydrated [twitter data](https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs). Aside from the python scripts that you will find in this folder, these analyses are also in jupyter notebook format in the [jupyter notebooks folder](https://github.com/katelyn98/Infodemic/tree/master/Claim_Mapping/jupyter_notebooks). All results can be found in image format in the [results folder](https://github.com/katelyn98/Infodemic/tree/master/Claim_Mapping/jupyter_notebooks). 

### Analysis Functionalities
There are several func scripts in this folder. Each func script has a doc string explaining what it does. You can customize the func scripts by modifying the config.yml file in this folder. 

### Other Notes
Biweekly updates will be posted below on progress of the analyses.

## Biweekly Updates
### July 6th, 2020:
We have identified and evaluated relevant research studies to extend in IQT Lab's Infodemic project. For example, features in tweets such as hashtags and URL links provide deeper insight into contributing factors to the Infodemic. Recent preliminarly results from Dr. Kathleen Carley and her PhD student Binxuan Huang at Carnegie Mellon University identify who is spreading fictious information on Twitter, what themes describe the fictious information being shared, and where it is being spread [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04278.pdf). They use a user-profiling system to predict critical features such as the political orientation and social orientation of a given Twitter account to track down Twitter bots. We have also identified and evaluated labeled datasets that label new news sources, news articles, and social media posts bosed on their political orientation, level of bias, and reliability. 

### July 20th, 2020:
We examined features such as geolocation and inferred account characteristics to better understand where and when mis/dis-information was spreading. While examining those features, we performed exploratory analyses of the top tweeted URL links in January from the Twitter dataset (since the later months are still hydrating). It will take several more weeks to access more recent data. Due to the high volume of tweets in the analyzed subset of twitter data pointing to another tweet, the Twitter.com domain was excluded from this analysis. We have also been looking into different visualization tools such as Plotly or Keylines to deploy our “claim-mapping” protoype. While our claim-matching system is being developed, we are manually curating URL links relating to particular claims. An example of a set of claims that we will map over is presented below:

**Identified Claims from subset of data for Jan. 21st-Feb. 4th, 2020 out of 4,546,609 tweets**

*Table 1: Data in table from [Twitter Dataset](https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs). Resulting claims were manually identified from parsing through a subsection of tweets out of 4,546,609 tweets. Claims listed are direct quotes from a tweet that shared a URL related to their tweet.*

### August 4th, 2020:
Over the last week, more data has been hydrated and processed which has fueled the progress in prototyping our claim mapping visualization. The claim mapping visualization is currently generated by a small subset of data from March and April that was manually labeled to create a hand-curated  to related claims by URLs. We noticed that is it very common to see a tweet that retweets a tweet that shares an external URL, especially tweets posted by new agencies. For this reason, twitter.com was included when identifying claims by a URL. Figure 2 below shows an exploratory Plotly dash app prototype of an interactive spatial-temporal visualization that shows tweets with their referenced URL by claim, location, and date/time.

*Figure 1: Data in table from [Twitter Dataset](https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs). Map generated from a hand-curated dataset for the months March and April 2020; dataset consists of 513 tweets labeled manually.*

Both to assess potential multilingual future directions, and to better filter our current dataset to English, we incorporated additional language checks to Twitter’s metadata. After running an experiment on tweets from April, Twitter detected 61.28% of tweets to be in English while a package called langdetect detected 56.28% of tweets to be in English. The package langdetect was chosen to be used in detecting the language of tweets because it is commonly used by researchers working with Twitter data. A snapshot of the interactive language breakdown bar plot of tweets from January through April using the langdetect package can be seen in figure 1. Note that the legend in the image does not show all languages that were identified because this is a still screenshot of a dynamic plot.

### August 18th, 2020 ###
We have modified the claim-mapping visualization to include narrative-mapping, where narratives are broader discussions around a specific claim. We have made significant progress with our narrative & claim-mapping visualizations, including the addition of two metadata analyses (Figure 3), and launching the claim-mapping dash app privately on the IQT network. The dash app prototype presents an interactive and explorative way to view who initiates, participates, and propagates a particular claim or link. The claim-mapping visualization can be viewed from the US, or several different continents including Asia, Europe, and Africa. This allows for the extension of viewing tweets all around the world from languages other than English. Each point on the map can be clicked to view the text from the tweet, the URL the tweet referenced, and the political affiliation of the URL if available . The narrative-mapping visualization is currently only available for the United States.

*Figure 3: Data used to generate claim-mapping visualization from COVID-19 Twitter Dataset [3](https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs). Visualization currently represents 563 tweets from hand-curated dataset between March, April, and May 2020.* 

We added two metadata analyses: volume of tweets per narrative or claim per day (left side of Figure 3), and volume of tweets per political affiliation for a specific narrative (right side of Figure 3). A supplementary guide has been created for transparency on how the hand-curated dataset was created and how these visualizations should be used.
